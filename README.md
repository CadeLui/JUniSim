# This thing simulates singularities in a defined, spherical space.

 Objects in the space are singularities with a mass, speed, and angle of trajectory.
 Gravity rotates objects to face each other and accelerate
 The simulation is still incredibly simple, so gravity still doesn't operate as expected in most circumstances.
 I have an idea in my head on how to make it work, but I do not understand the math well enough to implement it.
